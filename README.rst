==================
Marvin 2.0 Backend
==================






This is the backend of the new Marvin, on top of the `mal-analytics
<https://github.com/MonetDBSolutions/mal_analytics>`_ library. The
high level idea is that this project will provide a REST API, for
querying the database containing the JSON trace objects.
